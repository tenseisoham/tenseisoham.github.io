title: "Strong Lensing Classification & Super-Resolution with Masked Autoencoders"
description: "Deep learning methods for astrophysics: explored ResNet-18 and Masked Autoencoder (MAE) models for classifying strong gravitational lensing images and enhancing resolution with ESRGAN. Included interpretability experiments with Grad-CAM to analyze model decisions and identify biases. Achieved improved super-resolution with physics-informed insights."
