title: "Visual Embeddings Solving Jigsaw Puzzles"
description: "A deep learning model using Graph Neural Networks and Autoencoders for representation learning via jigsaw puzzle paradigms. Introduced a Segmented Flow warp approach, achieving 60% validation accuracy, competing with SOTA methods. Original idea was to devise a efficient pre-training like solving jigsaw, to improve downstream performance in the wild for visual tasks."
