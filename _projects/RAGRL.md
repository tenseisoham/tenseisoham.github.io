title: "RAG Optimizations with Reinforcement Learning"
description: "A novel reinforcement learning-based optimization strategy to improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) performance. Evaluates retriever performance across diverse conversational datasets using text analysis metrics, various retrieval techniques, and RL policies such as DQN, PPO, and Multi-Armed Bandits to reduce irrelevant content and improve response quality."
