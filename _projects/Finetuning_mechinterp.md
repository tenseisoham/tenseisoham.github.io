title: "Latent Space Collapse? Understanding the Effects of Narrow Fine-Tuning on LLMs"
description: "Explored how narrow fine-tuning reshapes GPT-2â€™s internal representations in a sentiment classification task. Using TransformerLens, we analyzed shifts in activation and embedding spaces, sentiment direction norms, and causal mediation experiments. Key finding: fine-tuning induces 'output squishing,' reducing diversity and potentially harming generalization."
