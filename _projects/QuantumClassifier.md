title: "Quantum Machine Learning Classifiers"
description: "Implemented 24 combinations of Feature Maps, Ansatzs, and Optimizers to evaluate the efficacy of quantum kernel‐based classifiers. Our best combination — Z-Feature map, EfficientSU2 ansatz, and L_BFGS_B optimizer — outperformed classical SVM across all metrics."
